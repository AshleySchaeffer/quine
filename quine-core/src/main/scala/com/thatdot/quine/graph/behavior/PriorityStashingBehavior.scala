/** Functionality for pausing the processing of messages while a future completes.
  *
  * Use this by calling [[pauseMessageProcessingUntil]] with the future. New messages will be stashed until the actor
  * is ready to handle them again, at which point they will be re-enqueued.
  *
  * Callbacks are accumulated in order and their effects will be applied sequentially only once there is no pending
  * callback ordered prior to it. If an earlier callback fails, later callbacks that have succeeded _will_ be executed.
  * So effects are ordered, but they are not dependent.
  *
  * @note actors extending this trait should have a priority mailbox with the priority function wrapped in
  *       [[StashedMessage.priority]] â€” that way, the order of messages that get unstashed is correct.
